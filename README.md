add-stuff
=========

Adds numbers. That's it. A playground for future endeavors. Or, seriously, an app I'll have on my phone to add up stuff.

The impetus...I had a bunch of numbers I wanted to sum up, but opening up Google sheets is a hassle, and who the heck knows where the calculator on their phone or laptop is buried. Besides, with a calculator, you can't go back and edit. Thus, why not build a tiny little webpage to add up numbers? 

Current to do:
[ ] Allow for expansion beyond 10 numbers
[ ] Ability to optionally add labels
[ ] Store all this valuable data forever!
